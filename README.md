# Login and Sign-Up Page

This project implements a simple login and sign-up system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can sign up for an account by providing a username, email, and password, and then log in using their credentials.

## Features

- **Sign-Up Page**: Users can sign up for an account by providing a username, email, and password. Input fields are validated to ensure all required information is provided.
- **Login Page**: Users can log in using their username/email and password. Validation checks are performed to verify the entered credentials.
- **Persistence**: User data is stored locally using Web Storage (localStorage), allowing users to remain logged in even after the browser is closed and reopened.
- **Responsive Design**: The pages are designed to be responsive and adapt well to different screen sizes, including mobile devices.
